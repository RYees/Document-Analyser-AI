1. Contextual Framing: Situate the topic of transparency within academic debates in the selected domains.
2. Comparative Synthesis: Compare how authors approach the issue â€” including areas of agreement, disagreement, and evolution.
3. Identify Gaps: Point out any theoretical, empirical, or methodological gaps that justify a deeper thematic analysis.
4. Citations: Include Harvard-style in-text citations.
5. Deliverable: Output a self-contained Literature Review section to be used in the final report.
