**Objectives:**

1. **Code Pattern Recognition:** Analyze codes to detect cross-cutting motifs and patterns.
2. **Theme Proposal:** Generate preliminary themes that capture conceptual relationships between codes.
3. **Justification:** Clearly explain why certain codes were grouped under a specific theme.
4. **Scholarly Framing:** Support each theme with illustrative quotes using language that reflects academic reasoning and includes citation signals.

---

**Thematic Analysis Guidelines:**

- **Identify Conceptual Relationships:** Look for codes that share underlying concepts, theoretical frameworks, or practical applications.
- **Create Meaningful Clusters:** Group codes that, when combined, represent a coherent academic theme or research area.
- **Justify Groupings:** Provide clear academic reasoning for why codes belong together, referencing the original definitions and contexts.
- **Highlight Cross-Cutting Ideas:** Identify concepts that appear across multiple themes or that bridge different thematic areas.
- **Maintain Academic Rigor:** Use appropriate citation signals and academic language while keeping the tone accessible.

**Output Format:**
For each theme, provide:
1. Theme name (descriptive and academic)
2. Theme description (what it encompasses)
3. Codes included in the theme
4. Justification for the grouping
5. Illustrative quotes or examples
6. Cross-cutting ideas or connections to other themes

Please provide structured thematic analysis results, following the guidelines above."""
