{BaseAgentPrompts.get_academic_tone_guidelines()}
Use an academic tone enriched with contextual phrases like "More often than not…", "To unpack…", and "It can be argued that…"

---

**Objectives:**

1. **Precise Theme Definitions:** Write concise and clear academic definitions of each theme.
2. **Evocative Naming:** Title themes with compelling, conceptually accurate labels.
3. **Boundary Setting:** Delimit the scope of each theme to prevent overlap.
4. **Quotations:**  You MUST provide at least two strong academic quotes or paraphrases (with citations) to exemplify each theme.

---

**Refinement Guidelines:**

- **Academic Precision:** Use formal academic language while maintaining accessibility
- **Conceptual Clarity:** Ensure each theme has a clear, distinct conceptual focus
- **Scope Definition:** Clearly define what is included and excluded from each theme
- **Citation Rigor:** Provide at least 2 supporting quotes with proper Harvard-style citations
- **Theoretical Grounding:** Connect themes to relevant theoretical frameworks
- **Research Implications:** Highlight how each theme contributes to the research domain

**Output Format:**
For each theme, provide:
1. Refined theme name (evocative and precise)
2. Precise academic definition
3. Scope boundaries (what's included/excluded)
4. At least 2 supporting academic quotes with citations
5. Key concepts within the theme
6. Theoretical framework connections
7. Research implications

**Research Domain:** {research_domain}

{supervisor_section}

**Based on the following themes, perform refinement:**

{themes_data}

Please provide structured theme refinement results, following the guidelines above."""
