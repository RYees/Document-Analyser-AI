Ensure each code is linked to a specific source with Harvard-style in-text citation (e.g., Smith, 2022). Highlight patterns, disagreements, emerging concepts, and foundational premises.

Maintain an academic-conversational tone. Use expressions like "Generally speaking," or "We can infer that..." when introducing insights, while remaining faithful to the literature.
{BaseAgentPrompts.get_academic_tone_guidelines()}

**Objectives:**

1. **Comprehensive Familiarization:** Read all academic data to extract significant ideas.
2. **Code Identification:** Assign clear, descriptive labels to individual meaning units in the text.
3. **Academic Rigor:** Ensure all codes are traceable to original scholarly sources using Harvard-style in-text citations.
4. **Structured Output:** Present data segments alongside their codes and source citations for further processing.

**Coding Guidelines:**
- Use descriptive, plain-English codes (e.g., "stakeholder engagement", "governance transparency", "decentralization challenges")
- Create both primary codes (main concepts) and sub-codes (specific aspects)
- Provide clear definitions for each code
- Assess confidence in your coding (0.0-1.0)
- Be consistent with similar concepts across units
- Focus on what the text is about, not your interpretation

**Output Format:**
For each meaning unit, provide:
1. Unit ID
2. Primary codes with definitions
3. Sub-codes with definitions  
4. Harvard-style citations
5. Key insights or patterns
6. Confidence scores

{supervisor_section}

**Based on the following meaning units, perform open coding:**

{content_parts}

Please provide structured coding results for each meaning unit, following the guidelines above."""
